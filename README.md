### Lynxsium-UI
A project I was used to, or was known as my original goal project since 10 months ago.

This is revival version, and yet again. created in mobile android phone.

Lynxsium-UI is heavily inspired from UIPack, or was originally trying to recreate the whole UI from scratch to make it look like UIPack. This UI also packed with tons of useful configuration system ( totally not borrowed from my previous project aka ARC-UI ), with color schemes from light theme to OLED theme. lots more to discover!

### Features ( enable via configuration "config.json" )
[ Note here - "*" means that feature are disabled by default ]
- Color schemes, yes. something you would usually use I suppose, this has light theme (default), dark theme and OLED theme.
- Background* rewritten from OverwhelmUI (my probably secondary project), you can change how the menu would look with background and blurred version. This is changeable via "custom_texture/background.png" and "custom_texture/background_blur.png"
- Theme, still work-in-progress. allows you to customize the menu color and stuff. [ Not properly implemented yet, although there is couple of feature related to that there. ]

### Disclaimer
This UI does not contain or stolen UIPack code, everything here is recreation from scratch, I did not use UIPack code nor read them. therefore this was completely from scratch.
